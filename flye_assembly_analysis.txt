Purpose: Run E. coli assembly produced by Flye through ABRicate and PlasmidFinder to further analyze E. coli genome. This file contains a copy of all commands and output messages produced while using 
each tool, as well as comments describing the process.


ABRICATE
Run Flye assembly through ABRicate 1.0.0 to screen contigs for antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes.
Date: 02/02/2022

[emaier@gra-login1 Flye_136x2]$ abricate assembly.fasta > flyeAbricate.csv
[mii] loading StdEnv/2020 gcc/9.3.0 abricate/1.0.0 ...

Lmod is automatically replacing "intel/2020.1.217" with "gcc/9.3.0".

abricate databases are located in $EBROOTABRICATE/db

Due to MODULEPATH changes, the following have been reloaded:
  1) openmpi/4.0.3

Using nucl database ncbi:  5386 sequences -  2021-Oct-12
Processing: assembly.fasta
Found 5 genes in assembly.fasta
Tip: have a suggestion for abricate? Tell me at https://github.com/tseemann/abricate/issues
Done.

Results were moved into Analysis directory.
Results saved in emaier/scratch/Project1/Analysis/flyeAbricate.csv

No errors were encountered while using ABRicate.


PLASMIDFINDER
Run Flye assembly through PlasmidFinder 2.0: https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/PlasmidFinder/ to identify plasmids.
Date: 02/02/2022
Software version 2.0.2 (2020-07-01)
Database version (2021-11-29)

Enterobacteriales database
95% threshold for minimum percent identity
60% minimum coverage
